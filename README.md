# Business_Intelligence_Project


This is a project I worked on as a requirement for Managing BI Projects IS 7038.

The aim here was to learn to create a proposal for a business intelligence project. I had to find data, think 
of how this data can then be monetized through a business intelligence project and then create a business proposal for it.
The data source can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-perm-visas

I used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard to visualize this data so as to compliment my business research and support my case.
